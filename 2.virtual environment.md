Activation of virtual environment
> source env_name/bin/activate

Installing packages through pip
> pip install pandas

Installing multiple packages through pip in a single line
> pip install pandas numpy scipy

Looking at the existing packages
> pip list

Creating the list of requirements (to replicate the environment)
> pip freeze > requirements.txt

Installation through requirements
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Deactivate the virtual environment
> deactivate

Deleting the virtual environments (as good as deleting the folder of envrionment)
> rm -rf <env_name>
